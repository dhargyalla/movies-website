# Top 10 movies-website

## Project Overview
Have you ever seen websites that compile lists of their top favorite movies of all time?

Examples:

British Film Institute: Top Greatest Films
Empire: Best Movies
New York Times: Top Movies List
There are even companies whose entire business revolves around helping people build lists of their favorite things, like List Challenges.

### What We'll Build
Today, we're going to create a website similar to these using Flask, WTForms, SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and more. This project will enable you to:

Create a visually appealing website to list your top 10 movies of all time.
Update your list as you watch more movies.
Keep track of and recommend movies to others.
By the end of this project, you'll have a functional website to showcase your favorite movies and share recommendations with friends. Let's get started!
